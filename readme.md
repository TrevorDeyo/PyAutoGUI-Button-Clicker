I made this to automate the install process for a wabbajack modlist, otherwise, I would've had to click a button 1200 times every time one of the mods finished downloading. Or buy a subscription to nexus premium.

Hold ESC key to exit the program.

Note: the mouse will move otherwise it blocks the button detection.
This is a walk away and let it do its thing kind of program.
I run it overnight.
